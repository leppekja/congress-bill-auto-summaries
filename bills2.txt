finds thatâ the manufacture, distribution, and importation of firearms is inherently commercial in nature; firearms regularly move in interstate commerce; to the extent that firearms trafficking is intrastate in nature, it arises out of and is substantially connected with a commercial transaction, which, when viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce; because the intrastate and interstate trafficking of firearms are so commingled, full regulation of interstate commerce requires the incidental regulation of intrastate commerce; gun violence in the united states is associated with the majority of homicides, over half the suicides, and two-thirds of non-fatal violent injuries; and on the afternoon of may ##, ####, blair holt, a junior at julian high school in chicago, was killed on a public bus riding home from school when he used his body to shield a girl who was in the line of fire after a young man boarded the bus and started shooting. sense of the congressit is the sense of the congress thatâ firearms trafficking is prevalent and widespread in and among the states, and it is usually impossible to distinguish between intrastate trafficking and interstate trafficking; and it is in the national interest and within the role of the federal government to ensure that the regulation of firearms is uniform among the states, that law enforcement can quickly and effectively trace firearms used in crime, and that firearms owners know how to use and safely store their firearms. purposesthe purposes of this act and the amendments made by this act areâ to protect the public against the unreasonable risk of injury and death associated with the unrecorded sale or transfer of qualifying firearms to criminals and youth; to ensure that owners of qualifying firearms are knowledgeable in the safe use, handling, and storage of those firearms; to restrict the availability of qualifying firearms to criminals, youth, and other persons prohibited by federal law from receiving firearms; and to facilitate the tracing of qualifying firearms used in crime by federal and state law enforcement agencies. #.definitions in generalin this act: firearm;

session h. r. ### in the house of representatives january ##, #### mr. schiff (for himself, mr. van hollen, mr. meeks, mr. cicilline, mr. cartwright, mr. honda, mr. ellison, mr. moran, ms. slaughter, mr. mcgovern, ms. norton, and mr. serrano) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the committee on the judiciary a bill to provide victims of gun violence access to the same civil remedies as are available to those injured through other means. #.short titlethis act may be cited as the equal access to justice for victims of gun violence act. #.findings and purposes findingsthe congress finds as follows: the protection of lawful commerce in arms act (in this subsection referred to as the plcaa) was enacted with the express purpose of prohibiting causes of action against manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and importers of firearms or ammunition products, and their trade associations, for the harm solely caused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products or ammunition products by others when the product functioned as designed and intended.. the intent of the plcaa was to bar a narrow category of lawsuits holding gun industry entities liable for damages solely on the basis of selling a product that was used in crime. the chief sponsor of plcaa stated during floor debate, this legislation will not bar the courthouse doors to victims who have been harmed by the negligence or misdeeds of anyone in the gun industry. â¦ if manufacturers or dealers break the law or commit negligence, they are still liable.. it was not the intent of the congress in the plcaa to protect gun or ammunition manufacturers or sellers who failed to exercise reasonable care for health and safety in the design, marketing, and sale of their products. federal and state courts have read the plcaa contrary to its intent, and dismissed civil lawsuits based on negligence, product defect, and other causes of action that are well established in statute and common law principles. this special protection from civil liability enjoyed by the firearm industry is not only contrary to the congressional intent of the plcaa, but also contrary to public safety, and unique among industries in the united states. as congress intended in the plcaa, the firearm industry should not be held liable solely because a product they made or sold was used in crime, if those companies did not engage in negligent or otherwise tortious conduct. however, as congress also intended in the plcaa, state or federal courts should not be barred from applying state common or statutory law to impose liability on industry participants who, through their negligent conduct or defective product, cause an injury in which unlawful activity was also a cause. as most firearms dealers are responsible businesspeople who do not engage in negligent sales practices, ## percent of firearms dealers sell no guns that are subsequently used in crimes, and #.# percent of firearms dealers sell ## percent of crime guns, the overwhelming majority of dealers need no special protection from liability for damages resulting from the criminal use of guns. allowing victims of gun violence to pursue civil actions in state and federal courts against the firearm industry on the basis of negligent behavior serves the interests of justice and fosters the adoption of responsible business practices likely to reduce the incidence of firearm deaths. the second amendment rights of law-abiding citizens are not infringed by allowing state and federal courts to impose generally applicable principles of civil justice law to negligent industry participants. purposesthe purposes of this act are as follows: to ensure that those injured by firearms have access to the same civil remedies as those injured by any other product and are not restricted from bringing suits based on statutes and common law theories of liability in state and federal court. to allow plaintiffs to discover and introduce evidence, including gun trace evidence, into state and federal courts where appropriate. #.equal access to civil remedies for victims of gun violence in generalan action against a manufacturer, seller, or trade association for damages or relief resulting from an alleged defect or alleged negligence with respect to a product, or conduct that would be actionable under state common or statutory law in the absence of the protection of lawful commerce in arms act, shall not be dismissed by a court on the basis that the action is for damages resulting from, or for relief from, the criminal, unlawful, or volitional use of a qualified product. definitionsin subsection , the terms manufacturer, seller, trade association, and qualified product shall have the meanings given the terms in section # of the protection of lawful commerce in arms act. applicabilitysubsection shall apply to actions brought before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this act. #.discoverability and admissibility of gun trace information in civil proceedingsthe contents of the firearms trace system database maintained by the national trace center of the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives shall not be immune from legal process, shall be subject to subpoena or other discovery, shall be admissible as evidence, and may be used, relied on, or disclosed in any manner, and testimony or other evidence may be permitted based on the data, on the same basis as other information, in a civil action in any state (including the district of columbia) or federal court or in an administrative proceeding.  <eos><sos>  strengthening background checks act of #### u.s. house of representatives ####-##-## text/xml en pursuant to title ## section ### of the united

consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned a bill to grant the congressional gold medal, collectively, to the first special service force, in recognition of its superior service during world war ii. #.findingscongress finds the following: the first special service force (the force), a military unit composed of volunteers from the united states and canada, was activated in july #### at fort harrison near helena, montana. the force was initially intended to target military and industrial installations that were supporting the german war effort, including important hydroelectric plants, which would severely limit the production of strategic materials used by the axis powers. from july #### through june ####, volunteers of the force trained in hazardous, arctic conditions in the mountains of western montana, and in the waterways of camp bradford, virginia. the combat echelon of the force totaled #,### soldiers, half from the united states and half from canada. the force also contained a service battalion, composed of ### members from the united states, that provided important support for the combat troops. a special bond developed between the canadian and united states soldiers, who were not segregated by country, although the commander of the force was a united states colonel. the force was the only unit formed during world war ii that consisted of troops from canada and the united states. in october ####, the force went to italy, where it fought in battles south of cassino, including monte la difensa and monte majo, two mountain peaks that were a critical anchor of the german defense line. during the night of december #, ####, the force ascended to the top of the precipitous face of monte la difensa, where the force suffered heavy casualties and overcame fierce resistance to overtake the german line. after the battle for la difensa, the force continued to fight tough battles at high altitudes, in rugged terrain, and in severe weather. after battles on the strongly defended italian peaks of sammucro, vischiataro, and remetanea, the size of the force had been reduced from #,### soldiers to fewer than ###. for # months in ####, the force engaged in raids and aggressive patrols at the anzio beachhead. on june #, ####, members of the force were among the first allied troops to liberate rome. after liberating rome, the force moved to southern italy and prepared to assist in the liberation of france. during the early morning of august ##, ####, members of the force made silent landings on les iles d'hyeres, small islands in the mediterranean sea along the southern coast of france. the force faced a sustained and withering assault from the german garrisons as the force progressed from the islands to the franco-italian border. after the allied forces secured the franco-italian border, the united states army ordered the disbandment of the force on december #, ####, in nice, france. during ### days of combat, the force suffered #,### casualties, or ### percent of its authorized strength, captured thousands of prisoners, won # united states campaign stars and # canadian battle honors, and never failed a mission. the united states is forever indebted to the acts of bravery and selflessness of the troops of the force, who risked their lives for the cause of freedom. the efforts of the force along the seas and skies of europe were critical in repelling the advance of nazi germany and liberating numerous communities in france and italy. the bond between the members of the force from the united states and those from canada has endured over the decades, as the members meet every year for a reunion, alternating between the united states and canada. the traditions and honors exhibited by the force are carried on by # outstanding active units of # great democracies, the special forces of the united states and the canadian special operations regiment. #.congressional

which was referred to the committee on house administration a bill to amend the help america vote act of #### to allow all eligible voters to vote by mail in federal elections. #.short titlethis act may be cited as the universal right to vote by mail act of ####. #.findingscongress finds the following: an inequity of voting rights exists in the united states because voters in some states have the universal right to vote by mail while voters in other states do not. many voters often have work, family, or other commitments that make getting to polls on the date of an election difficult or impossible. under current state laws, many of these voters are not permitted to vote by mail. ## states and the district of columbia currently allow universal absentee voting (also known as no-excuse absentee voting), which permits any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason for the request, and no state which has implemented no-excuse absentee voting has switched back. voting by mail gives voters more time to consider their choices, which is especially important as many ballots contain greater numbers of questions about complex issues than in the past due to the expanded use of the initiative and referendum process in many states. allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can lead to increased voter participation. allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can reduce waiting times for those voters who choose to vote at the polls. voting by mail is preferable to many voters as an alternative to going to the polls. voting by mail has become increasingly popular with voters who want to be certain that they are able to vote no matter what comes up on election day. no evidence exists suggesting the potential for fraud in absentee balloting is greater than the potential for fraud by any other method of voting. many of the reasons which voters in many states are required to provide in order to vote by mail require the revelation of personal information about health, travel plans, or religious activities, which violate votersâ privacy while doing nothing to prevent voter fraud. state laws which require voters to obtain a notary signature to vote by mail only add cost and inconvenience to voters without increasing security. #.promoting ability of voters to vote by mail in federal elections in generalsubtitle a of title iii of the help america vote act of #### is amended by inserting after section ### the following new section: ###a.promoting ability of voters to vote by mail in generalif an individual in a state is eligible to cast a vote in an election for federal office, the state may not impose any additional conditions or requirements on the eligibility of the individual to cast the vote in such election by mail, except to the extent that the state imposes a deadline for requesting the ballot and related voting materials from the appropriate state or local election official and for returning the ballot to the appropriate state or local election official. rule of constructionnothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of states to conduct elections for federal office through the use of polling places at which individuals cast ballots on the date of the election. effective datea state shall be required to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to elections for federal office held in years beginning with ####. . conforming amendment relating to enforcementsection ### of such act (## u.s.c. #####) is amended by striking and ### and inserting ###, and ###a. clerical amendmentthe table of contents for such act is amended by inserting after the item relating to section ### the following new item: sec. ###a. promoting ability of voters to vote by mail. .  <eos>
