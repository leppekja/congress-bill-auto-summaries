# Overview of Data

Data included in this directory is either subset, examples, or supplementary data. The main dataset created by the data collection and preprocessing pipeline is roughly 1.5 GB and not included in this repository.

A majority of models were trained on the Minimum_Length_Sample.csv data. This contains the subset of the data with the shortest bill lengths in the dataset.

Text files were used in the adapted HW4 notebook to create a basic language model and are supplementary only to the main summarization project.
