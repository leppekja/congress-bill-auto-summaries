`LM_From_HW4_On_Bills_DATA.ipynb` was written by Jacob Leppek as part of CAPP 30255, with only a minor alteration to the data source, and should not be considered as part of the abstract summarization process. It was only done to check results of data and compare to generated code against the Decoder.

`auto_summarization.ipynb` is version 1 of auto2 and has been deprecated.
`auto3.ipynb` is a variation of auto2 to incorporate a standardized dataset.
